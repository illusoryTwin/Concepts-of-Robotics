\section{Skew symmetric}

Skew symmetric is a square matrix for which holds the following property:
\[A^T = -A\]

\[A^T = -A, and B^T= -B, then we have (A + B)^T = -(A + B)\]



\subsection{Intuition behind poles}
In control theory, the system state-space equation

\[\dot{x} = Ax+Bu\]

\[y=Cx+Du\]

has the transfer function

\[G(s)=C(sI-A)^{-1}B+D.\]

Since \((sI-A)^{-1}=\text{adj}(sI-A)\det(sI-A)\), where \(\text{adj}(sI-A)\) is the adjugate of \(sI-A\), the poles of \(G(s)\) are the numbers that satisfy \(\det(sI-A)=0\). This is exactly the characteristic equation of matrix \(A\), whose solutions are the eigenvalues of \(A\).
