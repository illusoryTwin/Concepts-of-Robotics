We created a system with a controller, but how to check the curren state of the system.

We can try to estimate it with the measurements, for example form sensors. But in real life 
the task is not that trivial due to some problems:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Lack of sensors. For a quadrotor we can not measure the height straight forwardly 
\end{enumerate}
