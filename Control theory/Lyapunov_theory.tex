Stability is not defined only for linear systems, but forr nonlinear systems as well.

There exist a small neighbourhood. Every solution that starts from this neighbourhood will asymptotically approach the same solution. 

\textbf{Asymptotic stability criteria:}
Autonomous dynamic system $\dot x = f(x)$ is asymptotically stable if there exists a scalar function $V = V(x) > 0$. 

Autonomous - only \frac{\partial epen}{\partial s}on its state, does not depend on any external input. 

Note that computing $\dot V(x)$ comes along with computing $\dot x$. 
We can think of $V(x)$ as energy (pseudo-energy).

Asymptotic stability means that the system converges, and marginal stability means that the system does not diverge.
