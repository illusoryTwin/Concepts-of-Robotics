\subsection{Critical Point (Node)}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!10,colframe=blue!50!blue,title=\textbf{Critical Point (Node)}]
Consider the following LTI:
\[
\dot{x} = f(\mathbf{x}, t)
\]
\(x_0\) is called a \textbf{Node}, or \textbf{Critical Point}, if \(f(x_0) = 0\).
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Stability}
A system is stable if:
\[
\|x(0) - x_0 \| < \delta \quad \| x(t) -x_0\| < \epsilon
\]

% We can think of it as: if the starting point is in the \(\delta\)-neighborhood of the node \(x_0\), the rest of the trajectory \(x(t)\) is in the \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood of the node.

% Or, the solutions starting from the \delta - ball do not diverge. 

% \subsection{Asymptotic Stability}

% A system is asymptotically stable if:
% \[
% \|x(0) - x_0 \| < \delta \quad \| x(t) -x_0\| < \epsilon
% \]
