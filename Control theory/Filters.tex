In literature, the system is frequently called a Plant, which in our case is a robot. 

\underline{Static system} 

Static systemns are linear systems for whhich the relation between input and output is constant

\underline{Dynamic system} 

Dynamic systemns are linear systems for whhich the relation between input and output depends on time. 

In Laplace domain,  plant 
$Y(S) = $

Time does not appear in this equaiton, but if we rewrite it into ode form,

\[\ddot y + 5\dot y + y = u\]

For these systems, the output depends not only on the current (time-wise) value of input, but on the entire history of input values.


Static systems form algebraic linear equaitons. Dynamical systems create linear differential equaitons


For the system we can create the controller and Luenbberger observer:
