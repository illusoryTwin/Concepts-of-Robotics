    The task of stabilizing control is defining the control law that makes a certain solution of 
    a dynamical system stable.
\end{tcolorbox}

Along with linear control, this is also true for non-linear. 

We can find control as a linear function of input:
\[u = - Kx\]

\textbf{Stability condition}


Then, the dynamical system could be represented as follows:
\[\dot x = Ax - BKx = (A-BK)x\]
